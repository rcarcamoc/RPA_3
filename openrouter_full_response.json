        "reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to analyze the provided table to find a row that meets all three criteria: Estado, Diagn\u00f3stico/Examen, and Fecha. \n\nStarting with the Estado, the criteria require it to be \"Examen Hecho\" or a very similar variant. Looking at the table, the Estado column has entries like \"Cancelado\" and \"Examen Hecho\". The third row from the top has \"Examen Hecho\", which fits perfectly.\n\nNext, the Diagn\u00f3stico/Examen must be equivalent to \"Ecotomograf\u00eda de Muslo Derecho\". The table's Apellido column lists \"Ecotomograf\u00eda de Muslo Derecho\" in the third row. Checking the equivalency rules, \"eco\" and \"ecotomograf\u00eda\" are considered the same, and \"Muslo Derecho\" matches the required anatomy. So this row meets the second criterion.\n\nFor the Fecha, the exact date needed is 30-12-2025. The Fecha Agendada column in the third row shows \"30-12-2025\", which matches exactly. \n\nNow, verifying all three criteria are met in the same row. The third row has Estado \"Examen Hecho\", Apellido \"Ecotomograf\u00eda de Muslo Derecho\", and Fecha Agendada \"30-12-2025\". All conditions are satisfied here. \n\nCalculating the coordinates: The table has 7 rows. The third row's midpoint in the Y-axis (rows) would be around the middle of the row's height. Since the image's height isn't specified, assuming each row is of equal height, the Y-coordinate would be approximately the middle of the third row. For X-coordinate, the center of the row's width, which is the middle of the table's width. However, without exact dimensions, I'll estimate based on the table's structure. The third row's center would be around the middle of the table's width, say 500 pixels if the table is 1000 pixels wide. But since the exact image size isn't provided, I'll use relative positions. The third row's Y-coordinate would be around 300 (assuming each row is 100 pixels tall in a 7-row table of 700 total height). X-coordinate as the center of the table, maybe 500. \n\nConfidence is high since all criteria are met exactly. The reasoning is straightforward as all three required fields match precisely in the third row.\n",
